/*
    A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
    Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
    If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
    You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
    You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int middle = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[middle] < nums[middle + 1]) {
                left = middle + 1;
            } else {
                right = middle;
            }
        }
        return right;
    }
};
